# Portfolio 

Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio website! This site was created using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills and projects.

In this website, you'll find information about me, my experience, and my interests. Additionally, I have included links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, so you can see my work in action.

Whether you're looking to get to know me better or just want to see my portfolio, I hope you find this site informative and helpful. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, don't hesitate to reach out via LinkedIn.

Thank you for visiting!
